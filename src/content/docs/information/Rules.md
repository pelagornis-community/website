> Please follow the above rules for smooth community revitalization

 1. No harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, trolling, stereotype based attacks, de-bloaters/privacy scripts, or spreading harmful/false information. You may be banned immediately and without warning or recourse.

2. Don't post essentially NSFW or anything political. If you're not sure if it counts as NSFW or political, don't post it.

3. Don't ask for money or any other goods (such as games or Nitro), or offer money in exchange for receiving support.

4. If someone else's misfortune is punished, don't encourage or laugh at the drama. If you have a conflict, do something to mitigate it rather than make it worse.

5. Do not mention or DM Staffs, or any other members who aren't part of the current conversation for any matter, unless you share a mutual relationship.

6. Use the correct channel or thread in your messages. If there is a better place for a current conversation, use it, and don't post the same thing in multiple places. In addition, no kind of political content (including memes) is allowed.

7. There is no illegal activity or content related to illegal activity, including black and grey market sites of any kind. This includes paid downloads of links or products to informal (e.g. unreliable archive sites).

8. Don't attempt to receive support or other requests from outside your server, as you cannot guarantee your safety from fraud, trolling and abuse. This includes suggesting the use of DM or remote support tools (e.g., quick support or teamviewer).

9. Non-contributive or incoherent behavior which is disruptive to the community and conversations will not be tolerated. This includes bumping/unarchiving threads without contributing anything relevant to them.

10. Please do not type in any language other than English. We cannot adjust other languages and most people here speak English. Failure to fulfill your obligations will result in warnings or mute.
