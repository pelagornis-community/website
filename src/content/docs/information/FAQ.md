## I got muted! What should I do?

Think about what you’ve done and wait patiently for the mute to expire. If you believe that the mute was unwarranted, message mailbot as above and explain clearly and calmly why you believe you shouldn't have been muted.

## Nobody is answering my question or helping me! What should I do?

Firstly, be patient. It might take a while for someone to be able to help you. Furthermore, consider if when you asked you’ve provided as much detail as possible to make it easy for us to help you. If you’ve done this, and you still need help and it’s been around a day or so and you’ve not had any help, then consider asking again.
